# Routing outgoing traffic through a cluster-wide proxy.
# If your proxy certificate is signed by a certificate authority which RHCOS does not trust by default,
# you may also wish to add the CA's certificate to the additionalTrustBundle. If additionalTrustBundle
# and at least one proxy setting are configured, the cluster Proxy object will be configured with
# trustedCA referencing the additional trust bundle.

#  httpsProxy: https://username:password@proxy.example.com:123/

#  noProxy: 123.example.com,10.88.0.0/16

# Certificate bundle that will be added to the nodes' trusted certificate store. This trust bundle may
# also be used when a proxy has been configured or when using a mirror registry.
