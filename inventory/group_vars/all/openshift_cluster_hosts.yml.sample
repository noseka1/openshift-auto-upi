# Configuration of OpenShift nodes
#
# Each OpenShift node is assigned one of the following roles:
# - bootstrap
# - master
# - infra
# - app
# The role assignment is required in order to create correct DNS records in dnsmasq
# and also to configure haproxy load balancer properly.
#
# The difference between infra and app nodes:
# The haproxy load balancer will be configured to forward *.apps ingress traffic to infra nodes
# but not to app nodes as it is expected that ingress pods are hosted on infra nodes.
#
# A typical production deployment has three master nodes, three infra nodes, and a number of
# app nodes. Master nodes host OpenShift APIs and controllers, infra nodes host ingress load
# balancer pods and image registry. App nodes run application workloads.
#
# A minimum test cluster requires one master node and one infra node.
#
# Note that the BMC configuration is only needed for bare metal installations. If not installing
# on bare metal, feel free to remove the bmc related configuration from this file.
# On the contrary, cpu, memory and disk parameters are used for virtualized installations only.
# They will be ignored if deploying on bare metal.
