  # Typical production installation will have 3 infra nodes. Regardless of how many
  # worker nodes you will deploy, you must set the value of the replicas parameter to 0.
  # This parameter controls the number of workers that the cluster creates and manages
  # for you, which are functions that the cluster does not perform when you use
  # user-provisioned infrastructure.
