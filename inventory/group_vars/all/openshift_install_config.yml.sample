  # Number of worker nodes equals to the number of infra nodes + the number of app nodes.
  # Typical production installation will have 3 infra nodes. Regardless of how many
  # worker nodes you will deploy, you must set the value of the replicas parameter to 0.
  # This parameter controls the number of workers that the cluster creates and manages
  # for you, which are functions that the cluster does not perform when you use
  # user-provisioned infrastructure.

  # The secret contains keys for downloading container images from several Red Hat
  # repositories like quay.io, registry.connect.redhat.com, registry.redhat.io and
  # also keys for authenticating against the cloud.openshift.com itself.
